  <p className="lead">One night when I had tasted bitterness I went out on to the hill. Dark heather checked my feet. Below marched the suburban lamps.</p>

  <p>Windows, their curtains drawn, were shut eyes, inwardly watching the lives of dreams. Beyond the sea’s level darkness a lighthouse pulsed. Overhead, obscurity. I distinguished our own house, our islet in the tumultuous and bitter currents of the world. There, for a decade and a half, we two, so different in quality, had grown in and in to one another, for mutual support and nourishment, in intricate symbiosis. There daily we planned our several undertakings, and recounted the day’s oddities and vexations. There letters piled up to be answered, socks to be darned. There the children were born, those sudden new lives. There, under that roof, our own two lives, recalcitrant sometimes to one another, were all the while thankfully one, one larger.</p>




  <blockquote>
    <p>I reflected that not one of the visible features of this celestial and living gem revealed the presence of man. Displayed before me, though invisible, were some of the most congested centers of human population. There below me lay huge industrial regions, blackening the air with smoke. Yet all this thronging life and humanly momentous enterprise had made no mark whatever on the features of the planet. From this high look-out the Earth would have appeared no different before the dawn of man. No visiting angel, or explorer from another planet, could have guessed that this bland orb teemed with vermin, with world-mastering, self-torturing, incipiently angelic beasts. <small>— Olaf Stapledon, <cite title="Star Maker">Star Maker</cite></small></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The whole world? The whole universe? Overhead, obscurity unveiled a star. One tremulous arrow of light, projected how many thousands of years ago, now stung my nerves with vision, and my heart with fear. For in such a universe as this what significance could there be in our fortuitous, our frail, our evanescent community?</p>



  <p>With a strange worship, not, surely of the star, that mere furnace which mere distance falsely sanctified, but of something other, which the dire contrast of the star and us signified to the heart. Yet what, what could thus be signified? Intellect, peering beyond the star, discovered no Star Maker, but only darkness; no Love, no Power even, but only Nothing.</p> 

 

  <p>Impatiently I shook off this folly, and reverted from the inscrutable to the familiar and the concrete. Thrusting aside worship, and fear also and bitterness, I determined to examine more coldly this remarkable “us,” this surprisingly impressive datum, which to ourselves remained basic to the universe, though in relation to the stars it appeared so slight a thing.</p>



  <p>We were after all insignificant, perhaps ridiculous. We were such a commonplace occurrence, so trite, so respectable. We were just a married couple, making shift to live together without undue strain. Marriage in our time was suspect. And ours, with its trivial romantic origin, was doubly suspect.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We had first met when she was a child</li>
    <li>Our eyes encountered</li>
    <li>She looked at me for a moment with quiet attention</li>
    <li>Even, I had romantically imagined, with obscure, deep-lying recognition
      <ul>
        <li>I, at any rate, recognized in that look</li>
        <li>So I persuaded myself in my fever of adolescence</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>My destiny</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Yes!</strong> <em>How predestinate had seemed our union!</em> Yet now, in retrospect, how accidental. True, <del>of course</del>, that as a long-married couple we <kbd>fitted</kbd> rather neatly, like <small>two close trees whose trunks</small> have grown upwards together as a single shaft, mutually distorting, but mutually supporting. <abbr title="abbreviation title">ABC</abbr></p>
